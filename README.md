#### Colours
For this project, I used the pre-made ['Enviro'](https://colorhub.vercel.app/select-palette/enviro) colour pallete from [Daniel Cranney](https://twitter.com/danielcranney)'s ['ColorHub'](https://colorhub.vercel.app/). I decided that I wanted green to be the focal brand colour of this project to symbolise growth. Also, I wanted the other colours in the pallete to be more mild shades of black, grey, and white, to make the brand green stand out.

The colours used were:
- `#3CB35A`: This colour was used as the brand colour, used mostly on call to action buttons/links, or anything else that I wanted to focus the user's attention to.
- `#03012C`: This colour was used as the primary colour for text (on a white background), and to give a contrasting background to some sections - such as the sidebar.
- `#635E79`: This colour was used sparingly either as text decoration or borders - I chose this colour as I felt it is fairly subtle/understated.
- `#FFFFFF`: This colour is used as the primary background colour, and text colour on dark backgrounds.

#### Fonts
I used a pairing of two [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat) for titles and [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?query=source+sans+pro) for regular text - based on the recommendation of [this article on Coral Nodes](https://www.coralnodes.com/best-google-font-combinations/).
